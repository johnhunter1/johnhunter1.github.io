<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support.

Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>
