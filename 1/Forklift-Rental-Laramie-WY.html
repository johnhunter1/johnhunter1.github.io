<p>The aim of our Industrial Counterbalance Forklift training course is to provide the candidate with the essential knowledge and skill to perform his tasks to the highest Industrial Counterbalanced Forklift training courses last between 1-5 days depending upon the requirements of the participants (refresher courses, intensive courses etc.), with partakers developing essential skills like machine operation, health and safety, and accepted good practice. There is a big difference between rough terrain forklifts and conventional forklifts. Forklifts are named after their fork-like prongs that lift up the load. If the employee was hired: The initial training and evaluation of that employee must be completed: Before December 1, 1999 By December 1, 1999 After December 1, 1999 Before the employee is assigned to operate a powered industrial truck.</p>
<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck — any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

<p>All types and sizes, perfect for any need, including warehouse, material handling, outdoor and rough terrain.

<p>The Teletruk offers typical savings of up to 30% on operating costs compared to a masted forklift truck. No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job. Models through 16,000 pounds lift capacity use a standard 100-horsepower engine; the next two larger models use a 142-horsepower engine; and the largest model, the LK30P44, has a 225-horsepower engine.</p>
<p>Transmissions on forklifts, in particular, can be subject to abuse. When not used for picking, these trucks can also be used for the transport or stacking of pallets. With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications.</p>

Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of lift trucks and other materials handling equipment.</p>
