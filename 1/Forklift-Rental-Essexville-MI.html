Forklifts range in size depending on their function. A forklift is a mobile machine that uses two prongs, or forks, to lift and place loads into positions which are ordinarily difficult to reach.</p>

Suitable for heavy-duty applications, our multidirectional reach truck is capable of handling both conventional pallets and long loads, such as steel beams and plastic pipes.</p>
<h2>Pallet Truck Lifting Equipment Essexville</h2>
<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines. When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials. The redesign includes modifying the forklift chain and the mast inner channel to create a wider window creating better visibility. The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>
<p>Our counterbalanced fork trucks are ideal for operations that require breakdown of pallets removed from trailers, long runs to P&D stations, or a combination of both. Larger items may be attached to a pallet or have indents for fork lifting built into the item itself.
