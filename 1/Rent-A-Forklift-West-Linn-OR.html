<h2>Forklifts Vs Pallet Jacks West Linn </h2>
<p>Operators of powered industrial trucks shall be physically qualified. Whether you are a grocer challenged by better space utilization, a pharmaceutical distribution center dominated by narrow aisles or even a paper warehouse managing multiple sized pallet loads, NWLT has the right forklift to meet your exacting standards. Ahern specializes in high reach equipment, which permits the safe lifting of people or materials to work at height.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Our Modern Fleet of CLARK and Komatsu forklifts gives you the opportunity to rent our equipment where and when you need it, without delays. As a renter it is your responsibility to make sure you only assign operators you have certified to operate the rental equipment. Lift kits are a popular choice for truck and SUV owners in Conroe and throughout the state of Texas.</p>
