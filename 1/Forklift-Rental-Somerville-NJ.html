<p>BJ's Rentals, Inc. Here at East Midlands Forklifts , we provide comprehensive forklift training for a variety of trucks and at various levels. An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>
<p>This Course has been designed for potential and existing plant operators who have received no formal instruction and those requiring refresher training. Rental forklifts are maintained to Crown's high standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Buying vertical order pickers comes in handy when the main job is order picking at increased requirements for productivity.</p>
