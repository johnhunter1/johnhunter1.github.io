<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>

There are also leveling kits that can be applied to a pickup, which raises just the front end of the truck so that it is level with the rear.

<p>13 Low lift trucks may be operated by a person seated on the machine, or by a person walking alongside, depending on the design.
