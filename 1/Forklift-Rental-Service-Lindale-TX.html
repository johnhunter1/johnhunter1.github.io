<h2>Safety With Forklifts Lindale </h2>
<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6‚Äù suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>Our counterbalance forklift training courses follow a specific set of guidelines as determined by NPORS & ITSSAR to ensure your staff are trained to the highest standard. They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front. It is nice to have the selection of on-line, PPT, and video training to choose from., and the additional materials and forms made setting up our forklift safety program a snap.</p>
