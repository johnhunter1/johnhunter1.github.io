<p>As mentioned in the preceding section, replacing or adding an attachment may reduce (down-rate) the safe lifting capacity of the forklift truck (See also General operations, below). Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.

Using a pressure washer comes in handy when washing lifted trucks, from applying soap using a foam cannon, to cleaning the inside of your wheel wells.</p>
<p>Just like with tires, wheels are also rated to carry a load, and most ratings max out at a specific tire size. Loads may fall or forklifts can easily be turned over tilting moderate loads. This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>
