H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years.

When it comes to forklift sales, it's important to find a reliable dealer who you can trust to provide a value-for-money solution. Manual pallet jacks have a capacity of about 5500 lbs.

Consider what you will be using your forklift for and what processes you want to optimise before choosing any new machinery and training employees. Like class 1 forklifts, class 2s are also battery-powered and are more optimally used within a warehouse rather than out in the shipping yard.</p>
<p>In a stand-up forklift, most often they require the use of a joystick which can present a learning curve to some operators. Rough terrain forklifts have inflatable tires with thicker treads which allows it to gain stability on uneven surfaces. Some industrial reach forklift trucks have a mechanism allowing its cab to tilt, enabling the operator to have a more convenient position while viewing.</p>
<p>Our provided pallet trucks is available in unique designs and sizes as per the variegated needs of clients. Since these machines can handle all kinds of terrain, you can shift supplies almost anywhere on a job site. There are different types available, including three-wheel models that provide better manoeuvrability, making them perfect for narrow aisles. On electric trucks the nameplate shall also show the truck weight without battery, the minimum and maximum service weights of the battery to be used, nominal voltage for which truck is arranged, and, where required, identifying number of battery required, and maximum rated ampere hour capacity for which truck is equipped.</p>
