On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option.

<h3>Forklift Training Manual Lyman SC</h3>
<p>A warehouse forklift can also carry weight that your human warehouse staff simply can't. Commonly found on port loading docks, scrap yards and recycling plants, and within an endless variety of other industrial applications, there is one consistency among every rough terrain forklift: versatility. Each is designed to work within extreme environments, natural landscapes, and the uneven ground often found on construction sites.</p>
