H Series forklifts use a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst to meet Tier 4 Final emissions standards.</p>
<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature.
