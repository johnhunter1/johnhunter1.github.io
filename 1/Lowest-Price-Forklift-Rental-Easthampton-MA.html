<p>Equipment Solutions for Your Short and Long-term Rental Needs. Lifted trucks have ample appeal—they provide an elevated line of sight, greater ground clearance and, most importantly, that head-turning, rugged coolness factor so many of us envy. Ideal for narrow aisles the side stance truck has the forks located on the side of the cab affording excellent visibility for the operator and minimizing maneuvering. CLARK Material Handling Company is so proud of this patent that they even sell t-shirts with pictures of the patent claim.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
