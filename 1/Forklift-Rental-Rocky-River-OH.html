This is a unique walkie counterbalance truck which was designed to operate in a large chemical manufacturing facility.

Even if that's not you, be honest.</p>
<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines. When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials.

The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>

The load limit of the lift truck decreases as the load centre is raised. Your solution: a high-capacity electric forklift.
