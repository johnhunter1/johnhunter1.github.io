<p>20. 20 Final Rule ï‚§ OSHA published the final rule for Powered Industrial Truck Operator Training on December 1, 1998. The dual tires in the rear are as wide as the truck itself, and almost completely outboard of the body, so essentially it's like three trucks wide and three trucks tall coming at you. The optional light and fan package offers enhanced lighting on the operator's platform, allowing enhanced visibility when order picking.</p>

Even if you specified you would need the rental for a specific amount of time, i.e. 2 days, it is the renters responsibility to make sure the equipment is returned.</p>

<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>This type of forklift makes use of pneumatic or air-filled tires, as opposed to counterbalance forklifts which use cushion tires. Control pedals and control platforms stood on or engaged by the operator's feet should have non-skid surfaces.
