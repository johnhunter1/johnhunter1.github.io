Load Backrest Extension should have height, width, and size of openings (not to exceed 6 inches in one of the two dimensions) sufficient to minimize the possibility of the load from falling toward the mast when the mast is in a position of maximum rearward tilt.</p>

<h2>Osha Lift Training Muncy</h2>

If you're a more adventurous driver that likes to go off-road, a lifted truck is a great way to enable you to challenge yourself to take on more difficult terrain.</p>
<p>Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them. The smaller design and increased maneuverability of narrow aisle forklifts allow them to reach tight areas and readily respond to unexpected hazards effectively. Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,” for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts.</p>
