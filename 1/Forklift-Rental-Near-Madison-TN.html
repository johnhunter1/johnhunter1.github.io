<h2>Truck With Lift Madison</h2>
<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
