An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>
<p>Our versatile Furniture Orderpickers enable you to equip your truck with the ideal fork length with extended baselegs for rail guidance application; select from varying fork lengths ranging from 42-96 inches.

Detrich says that such features as the clear-view” mast (with lift cylinders on the outside of the mast to provide an unhindered view to the forks), shorter turning radii, hydraulic side-shift of carriage and forks, and improved ergonomic operator platforms result in machines that provide operators with greater control, convenience, and comfort.</p>
<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>

<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
