A conveyor, overhead hoist, or equivalent material handling equipment shall be provided for handling batteries. Off-road forklifts are suitable for almost any environment (construction sites, docks, forests, etc.), they offer increased mobility and excellent results in areas where the terrain is rough.

<p>3. 3 Acknowledgment OSHA's Office of Training and Education wishes to acknowledge the following for contributing some of the graphics used in this presentation:  Caterpillar Lift Trucks  Mason Contractors Association of America  Industrial Truck Association  State of Utah Labor Commission - Occupational Safety & Health Division  Steamship Trade Association of Baltimore  Taylor Machine Works, Inc.</p>
<p>The G2 features a 4 inch elevated off road suspension lift, custom G2 wheels, and 33 inch all-terrain tires. Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>

A forklift (also called a lift truck or a forklift truck) is a vehicle designated to move materials in places such as warehouses, factories, farms and many more.</p>

<p>Forklifts have different shapes and sizes, also meet different and varied purposes. An additional set of wheels allows pallet truck to be moved sideways in addition to being the conventional forward and back directions.

<p>These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires.
