<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced — meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability. Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>

Each Kit includes a set of "Load Leveling" Air springs specifically created to maximize load carrying capacity, ride quality, stability and overall braking control. As order pickers are mostly operated at elevated heights, it is important that operators are properly trained on maneuvering and safety of these trucks.</p>
<p>Gap guards are used to fill in this area and make these lifted trucks look better. Our reach truck training courses are ideal as conversion training for operators already experienced and skilled in using typical counterbalance fork lifts, with a range of the essential skills and knowledge crossing over between the two. An unimpeded view of loads and the surrounding area are a fundamental requirement for safe truck operation.</p>

<p>Our order pickers are available in brands you can trust such as Unicarriers, EP Equipment and Xilin and are backed by 100% after sales service and support. The dual path is perfect for that driver who carries more weight on one side of their truck than the other. Rough terrain forklifts have increased traction on the tyres for navigation over poor terrain. Always start the engine while seated in the operator's position—never while standing alongside the forklift.</p>
