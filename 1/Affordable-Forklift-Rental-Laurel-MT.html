We offer flexible rent-to-own options on our Hyster and Yale forklifts, an extensive selection of new material handling equipment , and a used inventory that is updated daily. A scissor lift used forklift for sale is generally used for temporary, flexible access purposes such as maintenance and construction work or by firefighters for emergency access, which distinguishes them from permanent access equipment such as elevators.</p>
<p>Side Loader popularity has been declining due to the more advanced multi-directional forklift that has taken its place as the king of long load handling. We've got forklifts reserved and maintained for rental customers, with everything from forklift hand pallet trucks, powered pallet truck forklifts and stacking forklifts through to 12 tonne forklifts and specialised very narrow aisle equipment.</p>
<p>The cost to rent a narrow aisle forklift is roughly $200 to $300 per day, $400 to $500 per week, and $1,000 to $1,500 per month. These machines can also navigate fields, pastures, pens, and loading areas. The largest of the "core" line of cushion trucks, the 15,500 lb. truck has the largest counterweight and the largest lifting capacity. Because of the additional weight from larger tires on your lifted truck, frequent oil changes are recommended when you lift your truck or SUV.</p>

We're always out looking for a great deal on a pre-owned forklift, so that we can be the main source you look to when you are wanting to purchase one.

<p>If you're based in California, Ahern Rentals is a great place to look into. Available in two main configurations, internal combustion (IC) and electric, standard forklifts represent the greatest potential for weight capacity - with the deck stacked heavily in favor of IC lifts. Reach trucks are the most common and are frequently used on shelves that have simple levels for a single load.</p>
