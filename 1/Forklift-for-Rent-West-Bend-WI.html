<p>So while you may find cheaper custom trucks elsewhere, we doubt they'll compare to the quality you get from us.

<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>The majority of all rough terrain forklifts will have pneumatic tires since they are designed for traveling outdoors, such as on gravel or in yard work. TPC's video training on Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
