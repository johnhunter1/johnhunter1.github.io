<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty. If you are a forklift operator, be sure to fasten your seat belt before moving the equipment. They're the most common type of cargo transport truck in stores, but they're also popular in warehouses and distribution centers, too. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>
<p>Whichever type of forklift your decide on to assist with your work, it is essential that you receive thorough and proper training to ensure that you can operate and maintain it safely and effectively.

Using the procedure outlined for these tests, a truck shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope for loaded truck (Test #N3), or an 8 percent slope for unloaded truck (Test #N3A).</p>

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
