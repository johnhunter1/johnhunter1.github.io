<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>

It has a certain vibe about it that says, I'm here, I'm big, and you should probably get out of my way.” Whether you're going for a little lift to help you gauge more rugged terrain, or a megalift for that monster truck street cred, a lifted truck involves a lot of considerations.</p>
<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift.
