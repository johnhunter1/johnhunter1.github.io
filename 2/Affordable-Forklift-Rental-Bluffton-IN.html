The TAWI Mobile Order Picker is a one-of-a-kind solution for mobile material handling and order picking from pallet racks.

Where possible, fork loops or jugs should be provided for handling by fork trucks. Whilst implementing some or all of the relevant measures above will greatly reduce the fall risk to operators, the best solution is to provide order pickers with fully enclosed platforms.</p>
