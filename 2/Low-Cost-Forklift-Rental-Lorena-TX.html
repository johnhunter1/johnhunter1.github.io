<p>Pallet jacks can be used to move pallets of new merchandise to the proper section where the merchandise needs to be put on display. Capacity requirements can arise without notice, so a forklift rental can help an operation stay nimble and responsive to changing business conditions. When you find forklifts that interest you, test and inspect the forklift in person at the auction.</p>
