<p>Our range of products include Order Picker Forklift and Forklift Truck. Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again. When you're looking to buy a forklift in Bristol, the first thing you should do is pick up the phone to us. It may well be that you already know exactly what you want, in which case we will provide you with a quote.</p>
<p>Never use a diesel engine, internal combustion gas, or propane powered lift truck models in confined spaces for long periods of time. Yet large trucks can't be raised and driven safely until their brakes are modified. Conform with manufacturers requirements as per the operators handbook, other types of information source and relevant regulations and legislation.</p>

<p>First forklifts appeared already in the early 20th century, and were used in World War II. Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors. One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking.

The counterbalance” term refers to the weight distribution for cargo loads; any pallets or merchandise are counterbalanced against the weight of the machine.

Or, give us a call at 800.578.6009 for a friendly chat about our favorite models of pallet jacks that we use every day in the Freight Buddy warehouse.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing. Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>

Having rust free suspension components when we go to install a lift, makes for a smooth transition from stock to lifted.
