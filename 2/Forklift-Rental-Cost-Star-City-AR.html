A 2000kg load can be sufficiently moved with some effort; however, with poor ground, a poor quality pallet jack, unstable loads, slopes, etc., it will be much more difficult for the pallet jack worker.</p>
<h2>Electric Pallet Jacks Star City </h2>
<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>
<p>Plus, if you need auto service on your lifted truck, or someone to set up your new lifted truck parts, the service specialists at Laura Buick GMC are trained in lifted truck service.

Counterbalanced forklifts have been a source of storage and handling systems, where they perform loading, stacking, distribution and horizontal transport functions. Renting is ideal for short-term jobs or situations where equipment needs may change quickly.</p>
