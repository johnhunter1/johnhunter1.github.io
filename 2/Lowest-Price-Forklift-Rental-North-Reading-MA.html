<p>Caterpillar forklifts are notoriously powerful. A parking brake (or mechanism) which may be a part of, or include the service brake(s), shall be provided and be capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 10% grade, whichever is the lesser. The innovative 3-phase motors in our electric forklifts combine powerful performance with minimal consumption of power.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
