The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
<p>This type of mast is common in rental fleets and just about anywhere else that uses forklifts. The following are examples of Class VI powered industrial trucks.
