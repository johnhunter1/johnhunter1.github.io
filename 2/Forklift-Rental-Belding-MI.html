<p>While electric forklifts will require less maintenance, they will never be maintenance free. To achieve worker safety, Raymond developed the Raymond virtual reality (VR) simulator , a supplemental educational tool that helps new and experienced operators learn and practice forklift operating skills on an actual truck in a secure, warehouse environment. They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>
<p>They can weather any environment and derive fuel from multiple sources, but they do not have the unique capacities that reach forklifts do.
