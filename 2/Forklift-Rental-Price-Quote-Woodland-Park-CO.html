Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet.

Apart from this, these rental services are rendered according to the client's demands. They work better than 4-wheel forklifts where space is limited.
