<p>Adding a Pro Comp lift kit to your vehicle will help to maintain vehicle ride height, reduce the effect of shock forces, maintain wheel alignment, support loaded weight, and control the direction of travel for your truck or SUV. Often called a tugger,” these versatile machines are most commonly used for pulling loads from Point A to Point B rather than lifting.</p>

Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
<p>It is used for material handling inside warehouses. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>You may also ask to view the forklift's service record or work orders. Figure out whether you want to stick close to Ohio or are up for a road trip, and then consider one of these great vacation spots to visit in your lifted Jeep. The other, more complex style of truck lift is a suspension lift kit.” The suspension lift requires more work to accommodate and usually costs a bit more.</p>
