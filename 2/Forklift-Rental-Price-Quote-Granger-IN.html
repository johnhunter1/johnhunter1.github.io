There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>
<p>It is used for material handling inside warehouses. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>Top models are equipped with features that include robust transmissions geared for quick directional changes, custom tires that provide enhanced traction on loose, rocky terrain, and two- or four-wheel operation for safe, effective navigation. Rear steering makes it difficult to stop a forklift quickly or swerve and still maintain control. These tools and techniques should make cleaning any lifted truck easier, but finding a good auto detailer may be the more economical option if you can afford it.</p>

Forks that are meant to carry the load are attached to the main body of the forklift by a pair of roller chain pulleys whose fulcrum forms a gear at the top of the mast.</p>
