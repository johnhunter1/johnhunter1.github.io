<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities.

Therefore, the driving experience behind the wheel of cheap used lifted trucks for sale is unlike anything else.

Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

<p>Just like with tires, wheels are also rated to carry a load, and most ratings max out at a specific tire size. Loads may fall or forklifts can easily be turned over tilting moderate loads.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
