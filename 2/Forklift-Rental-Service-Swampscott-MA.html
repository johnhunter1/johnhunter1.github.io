<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns.

Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
