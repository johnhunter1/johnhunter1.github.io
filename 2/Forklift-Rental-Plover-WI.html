Each is designed to work within extreme environments, natural landscapes, and the uneven ground often found on construction sites.</p>
<p>The following are examples of Class IV powered industrial trucks. Semi-experience operator training - A slightly rare form of training, this is useful for those who have learnt to drive forklifts elsewhere, such as in a garden or other private property, but don't have formal training. These chargers may be set to a variety of voltages which makes them ideal for charging different types of trucks.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
