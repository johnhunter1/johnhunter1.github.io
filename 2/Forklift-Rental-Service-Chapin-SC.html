Better ground clearance than Pneumatic Tire forklift. Let our sales representatives know exactly what the application is and we will help you determine what type of forklifts are best. You'll now be able to see further down the road and over other vehicles. The conditions on site at construction, mining, forestry, and similar jobs are too tough for ordinary forklifts.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>

The optional light and fan package offers enhanced lighting on the operator's platform, allowing enhanced visibility when order picking.</p>
<h2>Hand Pallet Chapin</h2>
<p>On an F-150, one needs about a 4" lift to put on 35" diameter tires which is really the minimum for off road use here.
