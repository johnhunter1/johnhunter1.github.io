<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame.

Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>
<p>For others, it's the enhanced functionality and driver satisfaction that makes these trucks attractive choice. Standard forklifts have little ground clearance as they are predominantly operated on solid smooth surfaces such as concrete floors. Toyota forklifts are designed and manufactured from the ground up with operator safety, comfort, productivity and efficiency in mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia. The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and should equal in weight to the rated capacity of the truck. Similar to a reach truck, the electric variety is only for indoor use.</p>
