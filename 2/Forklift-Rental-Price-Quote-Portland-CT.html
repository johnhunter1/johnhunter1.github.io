With proper care and maintenance, a lifted truck provides many benefits for the off-road adventure seeker. We offer to our clients a Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck that has high load bearing capacity and is provided with nylon wheels for quiet and smooth rolling over rough surfaces.</p>

We are able to meet your long-term and short-term forklift requirements whether you are based within close proximity to a major city or in a small town.

<p>All parts are made of stainless including hydraulic pump, fork frame, handle, push rod, bearing, pin, and bolt, etc. Warehouses and fulfillment centers with tall and deep racking commonly use reach trucks. You will also need to know what the required turning radius is, and also, the minimum aisle width the lift truck will be working in. This will determine the kind of forklift needed to be able to maneuver through the space in which the truck is working.</p>
<p>This can occur if the forklift has loads that are over its designed capacity. Keep in mind that the higher you are lifting a load the lower the capacity will become. Self-driving forklifts, blockchain technology, ergonomic designs, virtual reality and lithium-ion batteries are all components of today's material handling equipment.

From a higher center of gravity to reduced visibility in close quarters, a lifted truck or SUV certainly comes with additional roadway safety challenges. While a dealership may not seem like the obvious choice to install your vehicle's lift kit, Currie's years of rigorous training, certification and experience in lift kit installation has made them the go-to experts in suspension enhancement.</p>
