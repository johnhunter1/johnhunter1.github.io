<p>20. 20 Final Rule  OSHA published the final rule for Powered Industrial Truck Operator Training on December 1, 1998. The dual tires in the rear are as wide as the truck itself, and almost completely outboard of the body, so essentially it's like three trucks wide and three trucks tall coming at you.
