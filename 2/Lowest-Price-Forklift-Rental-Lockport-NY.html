Due to the widely varying types of fork lifts produced, fork lift operation may require certification and licensure. Truck frame - the base of the machine to which the mast, axles, wheels, counterweight, overhead guard and power source are attached.</p>
<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
<p>This description refers to the type of pallet or product the jack is able to carry. Toyota Forklifts has introduced three new order pickers.

They can reach heights up to 390″ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries.
