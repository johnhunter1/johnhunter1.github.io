<p>A rough terrain forklift is durable and adaptable, making an excellent addition to a workforce that works hard across challenging terrain. Due to the widely varying types of fork lifts produced, fork lift operation may require certification and licensure. Truck frame - the base of the machine to which the mast, axles, wheels, counterweight, overhead guard and power source are attached.</p>
<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>

They can reach heights up to 390â€³ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries.
