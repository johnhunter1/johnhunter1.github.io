Ohio Power Tool is proud to be one of the exclusive distributors and repair facilities for Gray jacks and lifts. These drivers should not forego lifted trucks, but should consider a lower height that would accomplish their goal without exceeding what is necessary.</p>

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
